# DSA Practice Repository

A structured and continuously growing collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems implemented in Python.  
This repository focuses on building strong problem-solving fundamentals through categorized and consistent practice.

---

## Purpose

- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Practice problems topic-wise in a structured manner
- Maintain clean and readable Python implementations
- Track progress using a dedicated DSA question sheet

This repository prioritizes consistency and clarity over shortcuts.
